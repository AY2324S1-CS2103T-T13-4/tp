### Project: Foster Family

This is an **animal foster manager** for **non-profit animal shelters** who currently do not have a good logistical workflow to keep track of foster families. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
