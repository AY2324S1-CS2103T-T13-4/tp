* This is **an animal foster manager for non-profit animal shelters** who currently do not have a good logistical workflow to keep track of foster families.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a streamlined workflow to **manage list of fosterers**
  * provides an **intuitive** way to manage fosterers' details, such as their **availability** and **animals they can foster**
  
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Foster Family Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)**.
